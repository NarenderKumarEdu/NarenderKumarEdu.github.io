The Indigestion of the Soul: <b>Why Coercion Kills Curiosity</b></h1>

            <blockquote> Curiosity is an appetite. But what happens when you force-feed a child who isn't hungry? This essay explores the classroom as a site of "cognitive indigestion," arguing that by providing answers before students have formulated questions, we are effectively destroying the biological instinct to learn. </blockquote>

<h2 class="western">I. The Census of Resistance:</h2>
<p>It begins with a simple question. Whenever I ask a student an
honest question: &quot;Do you actually like coming to school?&quot;
The immediate answer is almost always a &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>Occasionally, a few students will say &quot;Yes.&quot; But when I
dig a little deeper and ask them <i>why</i> they like it, the truth
comes out. They do not come for the Computer Science lab or the
English literature. They come to meet their friends. They come for
the lunch break and the free time in between periods.</p>
<p>If you observe closely, you will see a strange contradiction. In a
class of 30 students, they enjoy the <i>setting</i> of the school,
but they hate the <i>process</i> of the school. They are happy in the
corridors, but they shut down the moment they cross the classroom
door. To them, the classroom is just a <b>&quot;waiting room&quot;</b>
that they must endure to get to the fun part, that is socialising
with their friends. They are physically present because they have to
come to school, but mentally, they are absent.</p>

<h2 class="western">II. The Force-Feeding Mechanism:</h2>
<p>The school bell rings, and the laughter stops. The &quot;learning&quot;
begins.</p>
<p>This is where the fundamental error occurs. It is not about how
long the period is, or how flexible the syllabus might be. The error
is that we view education as a <b>Data Transfer</b> rather than a
<b>Biological Process</b>.</p>
<p>We operate on the assumption that if a teacher speaks a concept,
the student’s brain will automatically record it, like saving a
file to a hard drive. But the human brain is not a hard drive; it is
a digestive system. It accepts information only when it is ready to
consume it.</p>
<p>Imagine a child being forced to eat a heavy meal when they are not
hungry. It doesn't matter if you give them 40 minutes or 4 hours to
eat it; if the appetite is missing, the act of eating is torture.</p>
<p>That is exactly what is happening with information. The teacher
stands at the whiteboard explaining the complex logic of <b>Python
Loops</b> or <b>Database </b><b>Types</b>. But the student’s mind
has not &quot;opened.&quot; They have no context, no curiosity, and
no hunger for this solution.</p>
<p>So, the teacher is essentially pouring code into a closed
container. The student is forced to swallow the syntax without
digesting the logic. The result is <b>&quot;Passive Reception.&quot;</b>
The student sits there, bloated with definitions they cannot
visualise and algorithms they cannot apply. They stop trying to
understand the <i>why</i>; they just memorise the <i>what</i> to
survive the day. They are not eating to get nutrition; they are being
stuffed just to pass an inspection.</p>

<h2 class="western">III. The Death of the Question (The Curiosity
Gap):</h2>
<p>The greatest tragedy of this force-feeding is that it kills the
most important human instinct: <b>Curiosity</b>.</p>
<p>Curiosity is nothing but the brain asking a question. It is a
mental itch that demands to be scratched. When a student plays a
video game and asks, <i>&quot;How do the graphics appear on the
screen?&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;How does my WhatsApp message reach my
friend?&quot;</i>, that is hunger. If you give them the answer then,
they will remember it forever.</p>
<p>But in our classrooms, we do the opposite. We give the &quot;Answer&quot;
before the student has even asked the &quot;Question.&quot;</p>
<p>We force them to memorise the syntax of a “For Loop” before
they have ever felt the need to repeat a task. We force them to learn
the definition of &quot;HTML Tags&quot; before they have ever
wondered how a website is built. We teach them the solution (Code)
before they even understand the problem.</p>
<p>When you constantly give answers to questions that nobody asked,
the answers feel like garbage. They feel like noise. Over time, the
student stops asking &quot;How does this work?&quot; because they
know there is no time for it. Their natural curiosity dies from
suffocation. They replace the question <i>&quot;What is the logic
behind this?&quot;</i> with the only question that matters for
survival: <i>&quot;Sir, will this program come in the practical
exam?&quot;</i></p>
<p style="border-top: none; border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; border-left: none; border-right: none; padding: 0in">


</p>
<h2 class="western">IV. The Backlog of the Brain:</h2>
<p>Because curiosity is dead, learning becomes a burden. This leads
to the Cognitive Debt (or what we call &quot;weak basics&quot;).</p>
<p>Computer Science, more than any other subject, is like a chain. If
one link is broken, the whole chain fails. You cannot understand
<b>Python Functions</b> in Class 12 if you did not understand
<b>Variables</b> in Class 9.</p>
<p>But because our system prioritises &quot;finishing the portion&quot;
over &quot;building the logic,&quot; students are pushed forward even
if they are not ready. A student might struggle with basic “if-else”
logic. Instead of stopping to fix this, the system pushes him to the
next chapter on Arrays and Strings.</p>
<p>Now, the gap is wider. The new code looks like alien language
because the basic grammar is missing. The student stops trying
because he feels helpless. The system looks at him and says, &quot;He
is lazy&quot; or &quot;He is not coding.&quot; But the truth is
simpler: <b>He is full.</b> His brain has a backlog of unsolved
errors, and we are trying to force more complex algorithms on top of
it.</p>
<p style="border-top: none; border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; border-left: none; border-right: none; padding: 0in">


</p>
<h2 class="western">V. The Bored Cook (The Teacher’s Tragedy):</h2>
<p>The tragedy is not limited to the student. This system destroys
the teacher as well.</p>
<p>In my experience, a teacher needs a &quot;Return Signal&quot; to
teach well. When I explain a logic, I look for a spark in the
student's eyes—that &quot;Aha!&quot; moment when the code finally
runs in their head. That signal tells me, &quot;Keep going, we are
with you.&quot;</p>
<p>But when you face students who view the lab period as a burden,
there is no return signal. There are only blank stares. The teacher
tries to explain the logic once, maybe twice. But eventually, the
teacher gives up.</p>
<p>Instead of cooking a fresh, interesting meal (writing live code
and experimenting), the teacher switches to serving pre-packaged food
(dictating programs from the board). The teacher stops trying to make
the students think and focuses on the only thing the students care
about: <i>&quot;Just write the code on the board so we can copy it
into our files.&quot;</i></p>
<p>The lab becomes a hollow place. The teacher pretends to teach by
typing, the students pretend to learn by typing, and the real logic
dies in the silence of the keystrokes.</p>
